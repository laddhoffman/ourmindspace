// Let's support a grid layout system...
// That can be done by creating horizontal and vertical subdivisions, right?

// Also there are a couple more considerations to make for these UIElement boxes.
// How big do we want them?
// Not just shrinking to fit contents

// How do we want to handle interactions among elements?
// What we have so far is this kind of top-down hierarchical model of parents and children, forming a tree of elements.
// This forces us to integrate each concept with its neighbors from the top down.
// What if we implement a protocol by which each element can negotiate with its neighbors?
// In cases where there is ambiguity, perhaps solicit input from a user.

// Let's consider doing this using a dialog among elements.
// Each one maintains some state (or references thereto?)
// Each one seeks to be aware of the considerations of the others.

// 2 extremes -- full centralization or full decentralization. What about options in between?
// We could have special a special kind of entity that carries the responsibility of understanding the considerations of
// the others, and has none of its own that directly interfere with theirs. A manager node. But when more than one of
// these operate in the same space they'll need to coordinate, so we haven't really solved the problem.

// Ultimately I want the viewport to be in the hands of the user. It needs to be under their discretion.

// Each entity can report its own considerations.

// In this immediate application, what we're trying to manage is the allocation of viewport space.
// Based on what? Well, based on content expressed through the provided API. So far, that is the following:
// UIElement
// - constructor(div, label) : UIElement
// - createChild() : UIElement
// - createChildren() : []UIElement
// - verticalSplit([]rowsInfo) : []UIElement
// - horizontalSplit([]colsInfo) : []UIElement
// - expandToWindow() : void
// - getLabel(), setLabel()
// - getText(), setText()
// - getDiv(), setDiv()
// - addDiv()

// Parents keep a list of their children.
// We create corresponding DOM elements for each of our elements.
// We can access all the DOM functionality through the DOM element,
// exposed via getDiv().

// So what do we have? An entity with properties 'label' and 'text';
// it can have any number of children, but must choose a single method for doing so.
// Current choice is between 'vertical split' and 'horizontal split'.
// In either case, the size and number of splits is arbitrary.
